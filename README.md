# repo-iDeaS-Scheduler

Booking application for iDeaS' product trainers. The application serves to display schedules of trainers and clients on a cohesively-designed web application and incorporate functionalities to book, edit, and remove, appointments between trainers and clients to facilitate coordination on training appointments with respect to various timezones, travel time, and such. 

The vast majority of this work is to create backend RestAPI functionalities to be able to create trainers and clients, and then upload their information to the server to track and create bookings.
